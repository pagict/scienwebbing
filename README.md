This idea comes from my friend while I asked him for a idea to initially bring my Python skill to life.

___So this project helps to block specific sites in a given time for focusing on your current task with network availability.___

####To Do List
- ~~block some affixed sites in a fix duration~~ (hard logic code, manipulate with hosts file)
- UI (first in posix system only)
- Capture packets instead of hosts file
- Monitor browsers. Add time punishment while trying to access the blocking sites in the time
- Self persistence. Persistent while closing the terminal
